<p>Java Spring, Neo4j, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, tomcat</p>
<p>I used Neo4j because it is a graph database and this is the most optimal way to perform shortest path(bread first search) search on a graph.
I can write in pseudo code on the interview if needed:) Because database does it for me I feel bad for not having it down</p>
